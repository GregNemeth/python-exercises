The Fibonacci sequence is computed based on the following formula:


f(n) = 0         if n=0
f(n) = 1         if n=1
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)    if n>1


Basically, it is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 11, ...
 

Write a program to compute the value of f(n) for any integer n.

 

Examples:
f(5) -> 5
f(7) -> 13
f(9) -> 34
